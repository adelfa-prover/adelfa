adelfa.el provides an emacs mode for developing proofs in .ath files. To
use, add the following to your .emacs file.

  (load "/path/to/system/emacs/adelfa.el")

Where /path/to/system is replaced with the actual location where the
system exists.

Note that reading forward commands works properly with the declaring
specifications and schema definitions, but the moving backwards or
undoing does not work properly outside of proof development.
