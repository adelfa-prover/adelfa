To Build:
=========
run `make' in this directory to build the system.
This will produce `adelfa.byte' which can be run to start the system.

Run `make test' to build the unit tests.
This will produce `test.byte' which will run all the unit tests.


Running `make debug' will build Adelfa with files compiled in debug
mode. To use debug information when running use
`export OCAMLRUNPARAM=b'.

Usage:
======
adelfa.byte
Starts the system. See system_reference.txt for more information about
using the system.

adelfa.byte -i <filename>
Specifies <filename> as the file from which to read input. Runs each
command from the file and then quits the system.
