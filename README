To Build:
=========
run `make' in this directory to build the system. This will produce
`_build/default/bin/adelfa.exe' which can be run directly or via `dune exec
adelfa' to start the system.

Run `Make debug' to build a byte code version of the system located at
`_build/default/bin/adelfa.bc'.

Run `make test' to build the unit tests. This will produce
and execute `_build/defalt/bin/test.exe'.

Run `make install' to install Adelfa to your system.

Usage:
======
adelfa
Starts the system. See system_reference.txt for more information about
using the system.

adelfa -i <filename>
Specifies <filename> as the file from which to read input. Runs each
command from the file and then quits the system.


To Build the Adelfa Tarball:
============================
If a tarball of the source is desired, for example to distribute on
the Adelfa web page, run `make tar' to produce adelfa.tar. To adjust
what files are included or not included in the tarball, edit the
command in the makefile. Arguments to `tar' are read as includes, use
the --exclude flag to mark items to be excluded.
