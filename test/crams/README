This directory's subtree holds a series of cram tests that serve as a form of
regression testing.

Information on cram tests can be found here:

Dune's integration of them here:

Cram works by recursively searching and turning each `*.t` directory into a
sandbox environment with the same files and Adelfa installed. The `run.t` file
in said directory specifies which commands to run in the environment and the
expected output.
