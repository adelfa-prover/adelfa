Adelfa System Description

Adelfa is an interactive proof assistant for constructing proofs about
derivations of the Edinburgh Logical Framework (LF). It implements the
logic described in [reference logic paper]. The focus of this logic is
on reasoning about properties of LF derivability; LF typing
derivations are the atomic formulas and the semantics is based on an
understanding of derivability in LF. Adelfa is an implementation of
the proof system for this logic which provides a means for reasoning
inductively based on the semantics of formulas. A feature of this
logic is the ability to reason generally about contexts through the
use of context variables and allowing for partial identification of
these contexts to provide a usable form of case analysis on atomic
formulas.
