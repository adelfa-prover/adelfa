This directory contains documents used in working out the design of
various aspects of the implementation.

impl_components.txt
-------------------
Works through what the necessary components of an implementation will
be from a high level to a lower level of detail.

impl_context_exprs.txt
----------------------
Outlines the components we will need for context expressions including
context variables and block instances.

impl_context_schemas.txt
------------------------
Outlines the components of context schemas and block definitions.

impl_datatypes.txt
------------------
An initial attempt at describing what the datatypes of the
implementation will be. (***NOT CURRENT***)

impl_formulas.txt
-----------------
Outlines the components of formulas.

impl_lf_sig.txt
---------------
Outlines the components of LF signatures.

impl_proof_state.txt
--------------------
Outlines what information will be needed in the proof state.

impl_sequents.txt
-----------------
Outlines the components of sequents.

impl_tactics.txt
----------------
Lists the planned tactics available to users and provides details of
what the tactics will be doing to the state and how they will
manipulate the various data structures. Includes discussions of other
functionality that is directly related to the application of tactics
such as unification and type checking.

impl_terms.txt
--------------
