Sequents form the part of the proof state which is most relevant for
constructing derivations. The tactics we provide will apply sequences
of valid rule applications to the current sequent to make progress on
the proof.

Sequents
========
Sequents contain an eigenvariable context, a context variable context,
a set of assumption formulas, and a goal formula. For this
implementation we will split the assumption formulas into those
arising from explicit vs implicit term arguments, allowing us to hide
the implicit arguments of terms from the user. We also keep weak
typing constraints with a sequent which identify equations on the type
variables which may appear in weak types in the sequent.

  Components:
    - list of variables
        (the eigenvariable context)
    - list of nominal constants
    - list of context variables
        (the context variable context)
    - list of formulas
        (the implicit assumptions)
    - list of formulas
        (the explicit assumptions)
    - formula
        (the goal)
    - list of weak type constraints
        (the constraints)


  Operations:
    - add eigenvariables
    - lookup eigenvariable
    - substitution application
    - add context variables
    - lookup context variables
    - add/remove assumption formula
    - change goal formula
    - update constraints
