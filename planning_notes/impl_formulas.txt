This file describes the representation of formulas in the
system. They describe properties of LF derivability based on the
atomic formulas which are LF typing judgments.

Formulas
========
The representation of formulas will have a constructor for each
connective and quantifier of the logic as well as a constructor for
atomic formulas. Since we will work within the subset of formulas
which are weakly well formed the quantifiers of formulas are annotated
with weak types.

  Constructors:
    Atomic Formulas
      Atomic formulas {G|- M:A} are valid if the judgment G|-S M:A is
      derivable in LF.
      
      Components:
        - context expression
        - term (representing the LF object)
        - term (representing the LF type)

    Top
      Top is always valid.
      
    Bottom
      Bottom is not valid.
      
    Implication
      An implication is valid if whenever the left subformula is valid
      the right subformula is valid. 
      
      Components:
        - left formula
        - right formula
        
    Conjunction
      A conjunction is valid if both subformulas are valid.

      Components:
        - left formula
        - right formula
        
    Disjunction
      A disjunction is valid if one of the subformulas is valid.
      
      Components:
        - left formula
        - right formula
        
    Context Quantification
      A formula with a context quantification is valid if, under every
      possible instantiation for the context variable (i.e. every
      context expression satisfying the schema definition) the
      resulting formula is valid.

      Components:
        - context variable name/symbol
        - context schema symbol
        - body formula
        
    Universal
      A universal formula is valid if for every term the formula
      obtained by replacing the quantified variable with that term is
      valid.
      
      Components:
        - quantified variable name/symbol
        - weak type
        - body formula
        
    Existential
      An existential formula is valid if there is a term such that
      replacing the quantified variable with that term results in a
      formula which is valid.
      
      Components:
        - quantified variable name/smbol
        - weak type
        - body formula


  Operations:
    - weak well formedness checking
    - substitution application
    - normalization
