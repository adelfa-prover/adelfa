Context Schemas are used to describe a particular subset of context
expressions which are made up of sequences of context items of
particular forms. This regular structure allows us to reason about
unspecified contexts.

Context Schema
==============
  A context schema comprises a name identifying the schema along with
  some number of block structure definitions.
  
  Components:
    - name
    - list of block definitions

  Operations:
    - define schema
    - weak well formedness check

Block Definition
================
  A block definition describes a sequence of context items which
  appear as a block within a context. An instantiation of the
  schematic variables results in an instance of a block definition.
  
  Components:
    - list of schematic variables
    - list of block items

  Operations:
    - construct an instance (and generic instances)
    - weak well formedness check

Block Items
===========
  A block item is a structure for one of the context items in a block
  definition. The terms of these block items may use the schematic
  variables of the block definition as well as any variables also
  defined in the block.

  Components:
    - variable name/symbol
    - term (representing an LF type)

  Operations:
    - construct instance
    - weak well formedness check
