Let us define the relation rev_acc between three lists as follows:

                  ----------------     rev_acc_nil
		   rev_acc nil L L



                 rev_acc L1 (X::L2) L3
		 ---------------------   rev_acc_cons
		 rev_acc (X::L1) L2 L3


Using the relation, we define the main relation, rev:

                rev_acc L1 nil L2
		-----------------
		    rev  L1 L2


We then have the following Lemmas

Lemma 1:
   for all L1 L2 L3 L4,
      if (rev_acc L1 L2 L3) and (rev_app L1 L2 L4) are derivable then L3 = L4.

Proof:

  We prove the (universal) statement by induction on the height of the
  derivation of (rev_acc L1 L2 L3); the hypothesis is invoked as we
  consider the cases for the derivation.

  If (rev_acc L1 L2 L3) is derived by rev_app_nil, then clearly L1 =
  nil and L3 = L2. But now (rev_acc nil L2 L4) could only be derived
  by rev_acc_nil and then L4 = L2, from which obviously L3 = L4.

  If (rev_acc_nil L1 L2 L3) is derived by rev_app_cons, the, for some
  X and L1', L1 = (X::L1') and (rev_acc L1' (X::L2) L3) has a shorter
  derivation. But then (rev_acc_cons L1 L2 L4) could obly have been
  derived by deriving (rev_acc_cons L1' (X::L2) L4). Invoking the
  induction hypothesis with (rev_acc L1' (X::L2) L3) and
  (rev_acc_cons L1' (X::L2) L4), it follows that L3 = L4.
 QED 

Lemma 2

for all L1 L2 L3 L4 L5,
  If (rev_acc L1 L2 L3), (rev_app L3 nil L4) and (rev_app L2 L1 L5) have
  derivations, then L4 = L5.

Proof:

We prove the statement by induction on the height of the derivation of
(rev_acc L1 L2 L3); the induction hypothesis is invoked as we consider
the cases by which this judgement was derived.

Suppose it was derived by rev_acc_nil. Then L1 = nil and L2 = L3. Then
we have derivations for (rev_acc L2 nil L4) and (rev_app L2 nil
L5). By Lemma 1, L4 = L5.

Suppose it was derived by rev_acc_cons. Then there is some X and L1'
such that L1 = (X::L1') and (rev_acc L1' (X::L2) L3) has a shorter
derivation. Since (rev L2 (X::L1') L5) has a derivation, by rev_acc_cons, so
does (rev_acc (X::L2) L1' L5). Using the further assumption that
(rev_acc L3 nil L4) has a derivation, from the induction hypothesis it
follows that L4 = L5.
QED

We can use Lemma 2 to conclude that the accumulator based version of
reverse is convolutive by picking L2 in the lemma to be nil. However,
to do so, we need to know that there is a derivation of
(rev_acc L3 nil L4). We cannot be sure about this unless we know that
L3 has a list structure. Fortunately, we can guarantee this from
knowing that (rev_acc L1 nil L3) holds.

To make all this explicit, we first introduce the definition of an
islist relation:

               -------------------
	            islist nil

                     islist L
  		   -------------
		   islist (X::L)

Then, we prove the following lemmas

Lemma 3

For all L1 L2 L3,
  if (rev_acc L1 L2 L3) and (islist L2) have derivations then
  (islist L3) has one too.

Proof:

By induction on the height of the derivation of (rev_acc L1 L2 L3);
the hypothesis gets used in the course of analyzing the cases by which
(rev_acc L1 L2 L3) was derived.

If it was derived using rev_acc_nil, then L3 = L2 and the result is
obvious.

If it was derived using rev_acc_cons, then for some X and L1' we have
that L1 = (X::L1') and (rev_acc L1' (X::L2) L3) has a shorter
derivation. It is easy to see that (islist (X::L2)) must have a
derivation if (islist L2) has a derivation. But then the induction
hypothesis leads to the conclusion that (islist L3) must hold.
QED

Lemma 4

  for all L1 L2,
    if islist L1 has a derivation then there must be an L3 such that 
    (rev_acc L1 L2 L3) has a derivation.

Proof:

By induction on the height of the derivation of (islist L1). We
consider by cases the ways in which it may have been derived.

If it was derived by using rev_acc_nil, then pick L3 to be L2: clearly
(rev_acc nil L2 L2) has a derivation.

If it was derived using rev_acc_cons, then for some X and L1' it is
the case that L1 = (X::L1) and (islist L1) has a shorter
derivation. By the induction hypothesis, there is some L3 such that
(rev_acc L1' (X:: L2) L3) has a derivation. But then clearly
(rev_acc (X::L1') L2 L3) must also have a derivation.
QED


We can now prove the main theorem. 


Main Theorem

for all L1 L2, if (rev L1 L2) has a derivation then (rev L2 L1) also
has a derivation.

Proof:

Since (rev L1 L2) has a derivation, (rev_acc L1 nil L2) must have a
derivation.

Using Lemma 3 it follows that (islist L2) has a derivation. Using
Lemma 4 it follows that there is some L3 such that (rev_acc L2 nil L3)
has a derivation.

Clearly, (rev_acc nil L1 L1) has a derivation.

Putting all this together with Lemma 2, we conclude that (rev L2 L1)
has a derivation.
